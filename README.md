JD's bash

## usage

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdinhlife/jconf/master/.jbash | bash
```

## Dependencies
### Powerline fonts
In order for the icons to display properly, a `powerline` font is needed.
[https://github.com/powerline/fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts)

Try `Inconsolata` or `DejaVu Sans Mono`

### git (OSX)
If it's not working (as in the examples), it's possibly because you're using OSX's git which is an old version. Try installing a new one via [brew.sh](http://brew.sh/):

`brew install git`
